type t

val v : ?bin:(Fpath.t * Fpath.t) list -> ?etc:Fpath.t list -> unit -> t
(** [v ~bin:\[(src,dst),...\] ~etc ()] is the installation of [src] as [dst] as
    binary files, and [etc] as configuration/artifact. *)

val union : t -> t -> t
(** [union a b] merge to sets of installation rules. *)

val empty : t
(** [empty] is the installation of nothing. *)

val pp : t Fmt.t
(** Print the .install rules to install [t] *)

val pp_opam : ?subdir:Fpath.t -> unit -> t Fmt.t
(** Print the opam rules to install [t]. If [~subdir] is provided, this will be
    used as prefix (i.e. if your unikernel is in the "tutorial/hello/"
    subdirectory (which is passed as [~subdir], the install instructions will
    use "cp tutorial/hello/dist/hello.hvt %{bin}%/hello.hvt"). *)

val dune :
  context_name_for_bin:string -> context_name_for_etc:string -> t -> Dune.t
(** [dune ~context_name_for_bin ~context_name_for_etc ()] is the dune rules to
    promote installed files back in the source tree. A context-name is required
    for [bin] and [etc] artifacts. The first one should be the cross-compiler
    context and the second one should be the host's compiler context. *)

val dump : t Fmt.t
(** Dump installation rules. *)
